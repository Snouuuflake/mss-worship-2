- [ ] Remove state (logo and liveelements from node)
    - [!] this may be an awful idea
    - Add useEffect event listeners in main window to respond with state
    - Requests for getLogo and getLiveElement have to be handled via promises to be private
- [ ] make VerseButton exist in a context because that many props is bad for health
